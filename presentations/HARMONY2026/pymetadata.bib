  abstract = {BACKGROUND: With the ever increasing use of computational models in the biosciences, the need to share models and reproduce the results of published studies efficiently and easily is becoming more important. To this end, various standards have been proposed that can be used to describe models, simulations, data or other essential information in a consistent fashion. These constitute various separate components required to reproduce a given published scientific result. RESULTS: We describe the Open Modeling EXchange format (OMEX). Together with the use of other standard formats from the Computational Modeling in Biology Network (COMBINE), OMEX is the basis of the COMBINE Archive, a single file that supports the exchange of all the information necessary for a modeling and simulation experiment in biology. An OMEX file is a ZIP container that includes a manifest file, listing the content of the archive, an optional metadata file adding information about the archive and its content, and the files describing the model. The content of a COMBINE Archive consists of files encoded in COMBINE standards whenever possible, but may include additional files defined by an Internet Media Type. Several tools that support the COMBINE Archive are available, either as independent libraries or embedded in modeling software. CONCLUSIONS: The COMBINE Archive facilitates the reproduction of modeling and simulation experiments in biology by embedding all the relevant information in one file. Having all the information stored and exchanged at once also helps in building activity logs and audit trails. We anticipate that the COMBINE Archive will become a significant help for modellers, as the domain moves to larger, more complex experiments such as multi-scale models of organs, digital organisms, and bioengineering.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Since its launch in 2010, Identifiers.org has become an important tool for the annotation and cross-referencing of Life Science data. In 2016, we established the Compact Identifier (CID) scheme (prefix: accession) to generate globally unique identifiers for data resources using their locally assigned accession identifiers. Since then, we have developed and improved services to support the growing need to create, reference and resolve CIDs, in systems ranging from human readable text to cloud-based e-infrastructures, by providing high availability and low-latency cloud-based services, backed by a high-quality, manually curated resource. RESULTS: We describe a set of services that can be used to construct and resolve CIDs in Life Sciences and beyond. We have developed a new front end for accessing the Identifiers.org registry data and APIs to simplify integration of Identifiers.org CID services with third-party applications. We have also deployed the new Identifiers.org infrastructure in a commercial cloud environment, bringing our services closer to the data. AVAILABILITYAND IMPLEMENTATION: https://identifiers.org.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Minimal Information Requested In the Annotation of biochemical Models (MIRIAM) is a set of guidelines for the annotation and curation processes of computational models, in order to facilitate their exchange and reuse. An important part of the standard consists in the controlled annotation of model components, based on Uniform Resource Identifiers. In order to enable interoperability of this annotation, the community has to agree on a set of standard URIs, corresponding to recognised data types. MIRIAM Resources are being developed to support the use of those URIs. RESULTS: MIRIAM Resources are a set of on-line services created to catalogue data types, their URIs and the corresponding physical URLs (or resources), whether data types are controlled vocabularies or primary data resources. MIRIAM Resources are composed of several components: MIRIAM Database stores the information, MIRIAM Web Services allows to programmatically access the database, MIRIAM Library provides an access to the Web Services and MIRIAM Web Application is a way to access the data (human browsing) and also to edit or add entries. CONCLUSIONS: The project MIRIAM Resources allows an easy access to MIRIAM URIs and the associated information and is therefore crucial to foster a general use of MIRIAM annotations in computational models of biological processes.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY: The Ontology Lookup Service (OLS) is an open source search engine for ontologies which is used extensively in the bioinformatics and chemistry communities to annotate biological and biomedical data with ontology terms. Recently, there has been a significant increase in the size and complexity of ontologies due to new scales of biological knowledge, such as spatial transcriptomics, new ontology development methodologies, and curation on an increased scale. Existing Web-based tools for ontology browsing such as BioPortal and OntoBee do not support the full range of definitions used by today's ontologies. In order to support the community going forward, we have developed OLS4, implementing the complete OWL2 specification, internationalization support for multiple languages, and a new user interface with UX enhancements such as links out to external databases. OLS4 has replaced OLS3 in production at EMBL-EBI and has a backward compatible API supporting users of OLS3 to transition. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code of OLS is available at https://github.com/EBISPOT/ols4 and DOI 10.5281/zenodo.14960290 with Apache 2.0 License. A freely available implementation is accessible at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4.},

  abstract = {Life science researchers use computational models to articulate and test hypotheses about the behavior of biological systems. Semantic annotation is a critical component for enhancing the interoperability and reusability of such models as well as for the integration of the data needed for model parameterization and validation. Encoded as machine-readable links to knowledge resource terms, semantic annotations describe the computational or biological meaning of what models and data represent. These annotations help researchers find and repurpose models, accelerate model composition and enable knowledge integration across model repositories and experimental data stores. However, realizing the potential benefits of semantic annotation requires the development of model annotation standards that adhere to a community-based annotation protocol. Without such standards, tool developers must account for a variety of annotation formats and approaches, a situation that can become prohibitively cumbersome and which can defeat the purpose of linking model elements to controlled knowledge resource terms. Currently, no consensus protocol for semantic annotation exists among the larger biological modeling community. Here, we report on the landscape of current annotation practices among the COmputational Modeling in BIology NEtwork community and provide a set of recommendations for building a consensus approach to semantic annotation.},

Motivated by these potential benefits and guided by consensus across the COmputational Modeling in BIology NEtwork (COMBINE) community, we have developed a specification for encoding annotations in Open Modeling and EXchange (OMEX)-formatted archives. Distributing modeling projects within these archives is a best practice established by COMBINE, and the OMEX metadata specification presented here provides a harmonized, community-driven approach for annotating a variety of standardized model and data representation formats within an archive. The specification primarily includes technical guidelines for encoding archive metadata, so that software tools can more easily utilize and exchange it, thereby spurring broad advancements in model reuse, discovery, and semantic analyses.},

  abstract = {Canagliflozin is an SGLT2 inhibitor prescribed for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering blood glucose by increasing urinary glucose excretion (UGE). However, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) responses vary across patient populations, complicating dose selection under altered organ function. Here, we developed a whole-body PBPK/PD digital twin of canagliflozin that integrates absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, and explicitly models renal glucose handling. The model represents canagliflozin and its major metabolites (M5, M7, M9) and was calibrated and evaluated using curated PK/PD data from 22 clinical studies spanning healthy individuals, patients with type 2 diabetes, and cohorts with renal or hepatic impairment. Simulations reproduced dose-dependent exposure and UGE across single- and multiple-dose regimens. Renal impairment produced modest changes in parent drug exposure but markedly reduced UGE and increased metabolite exposure, consistent with reduced glucose filtration and impaired metabolite clearance. Under hepatic impairment, simulations predicted increased canagliflozin exposure with altered metabolite profiles, while PD effects were minimal, although evaluation was limited by sparse clinical PD endpoints. All model files, simulation scripts, and curated datasets are provided in open SBML workflows in accordance with FAIR principles, enabling reproducible simulations and reuse for model-informed analyses of canagliflozin PK/PD variability.},
